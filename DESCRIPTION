Description: A modern view on the principal component analysis biplot with 
    calibrated axes. Create principal component analysis biplots rendered in 
    HTML with significant reactivity embedded within the plot. Furthermore, 
    the traditional biplot view is enhanced by translated axes with inter-class
    kernel densities superimposed.
