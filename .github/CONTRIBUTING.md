# Contributing to bipl5

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the bipl5 package! For the most part if 
you can note any behavioral problems by opening a github issue. 


## Life Cycle Statement

This package is

- In an initially stable state of development focusing primarily on PCA biplots.
- A great deal of active subsequent development is envisioned by extending it
  to other types of biplots, specifically CVA biplots in the near future.
