## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
x<-PCAbiplot(iris[,-5],group=iris[,5],scale=TRUE)
x$bipl
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
y<-PCAbiplot(iris[,-5],group=iris[,5],scale=TRUE)|> TDAbiplot(dist=1,inflate=1,symbol=c("circle","diamond","square"))
y$bipl
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
